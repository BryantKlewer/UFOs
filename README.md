# UFOs

## Project Overview
* The purpose of this project is to create a website using JavaScript and HTML. This website will be used in order to display and filter UFO sightings data from across the United States and Canada.   

## Resources
* Data source: app.js, data.js, style.css, index.html
* Software: Visual Studio Code v1.7

## Results
* By default, the complete data table is listed on the right side of the webpage with a filter to the left as seen below.

* Filtered search only utilizing one criteria.

## Summary
* One of the major drawbacks of this webpage is that the data itself. The data has not been cleaned and formatted making it inconsistant. For example, in the "comments" column, there is text formatting errors throughout. Additionally, the time formatting in the "duration" column is inconsistant and there are misspellings as well. Times are spelled out such as "one minute", minutes are formatted as "min", "min.", "mins" and "minutes". Some times only have numbers with no seconds or minutes to specify and there is one that has a location in the duration column, "downtown".

![time_errors](https://github.com/BryantKlewer/UFOs/blob/main/screen%20shots/time_errors.png)

* A couple of recommendations for additional development that would be suggested are:
1) Clean and format the data first and foremost. Correct all spelling errors, utilize proper capitalization in the location information, and format the time uniformally such as "2 hours" "30 minutes" or "15 seconds".
2) Add a sorting option to the column headers for Date, State, Country, Shape, and Duration in order to sort the filtered results.
